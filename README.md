**Brandelli** in italian means shreds, like the ones of Arlecchino's costume. (Reference [here](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Harlequin) if you don't know what we are talking about)
This is a react componet library that works both in typescript and regula JSX.

# Principles

We structured and pampered every component following these simple principles:

1. **Zero impact** – try to create as less components as possible
2. **Recycle** – try to code so you will have to write as less as possible in future
3. **Separate** – try to identify and define each component function

```bash
yarn add brandelli
