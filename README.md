# Brandelli

**Brandelli** is a react componet library.

# Principles

We structured and pampered every component following these simple principles:

1. **Zero impact** – try to create as less components as possible
2. **Recycle** – try to code so you will have to write as less as possible in future
3. **Separate** – try to identify and define each component function

# How to

As simple as

```bash
yarn
# or
npm install
```

and

```bash
yarn start
# or
npm run start
```
